DONE. Graph page 10 : add main effect

DONE.  Do analysis without kinship words.


DONE: Predict specific linguistic domain from all of d-place.

DONE: Analysis with overall d-place distances:
	Check that all domains are being included
	Did I skip some out at the compilation stage?

DONE: Add geographic distance to Mantel test.

DONE: Analysis: Compare each ling domain to a regression with:
	-  Overall D-place distance
	-  Phylogenetic distance
	-  Geographic distance?
	Prediction: domains that seem more "cultural" will have stronger link to D-PLACE

Plots for the paper:
	Splitstrees
	
Phylogenetic tree:
	Come up with graph.
	
Example of actual differences in cult~ling correlation
	e.g. "plough" in industrial/agricultural cultures

Human similarity datasets:

RELSIM/SIMLEX:
	Average similarity scores is low, 
	Not systematic about which pairs are sampled
	FacebookMuse ~ correlations are there (weak), but not all langs (and not robust).

SmallWorldOfWords
	Dutch/English. Small correlations, but not robust.
	
Lexical Norms (concreteness, valence)
	Some similarity
	[send Indonesian and Dutch data?]

Age of acquisition
	Small correlation. 
	
Translation norms
	Correlation
