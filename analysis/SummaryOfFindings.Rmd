## Main analyses of Wikipedia data.

See the main text for a summary of the main analyses using the Wikipedia data.

## Analyses of the estimates from the Common Crawl data

Mixed effects model: The correlation between semantic alignment and cultural similarity was significant (\input{"../results/stats/tex/MEM_CulturalVsLinguistic_CC.tex"}).  See the figure 1 below:

## Analyses of the estimates from the Subtitles data

Mixed effects model: The correlation between semantic alignment and cultural similarity was not significant (\input{"../results/stats/tex/MEM_CulturalVsLinguistic_SUBS.tex"}).  See the figure 2 below:

## Analysis of numerals

The analyses of numerals found:

-  1 and 2 have lower alignment due to often being grammaticalised as indefinite or dual marker (Givon, 1981). 
-  Numbers 3-12 generally have high alignment (mean local alignment = 0.87), and higher numbers decline in alignment up to 1000.
-  There are also language-specific differences due to how numerals are constructed (e.g. base, combination rules, see Calude & Verkerk, 2016), or for irregular forms (e.g. 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 in Danish).
-  Some number words have alternative associations due to homophones (e.g. the Hungarian 7 is used directly to mean 'week', and 'neuf' in French means '9' or 'new').
-  The historical distance between languages did not predict much of the variation.
